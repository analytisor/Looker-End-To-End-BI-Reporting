## üìä Project 1: Paid Media Performance Dashboard

**Audience**: Marketing and Acquisition Teams  
**Goal**: Enable paid media managers to self-serve campaign performance insights and reduce time spent on weekly executive reporting.

### üîç Features
- Cross-channel filters (Meta, Google Ads, Amazon)
- Campaign and creative-level drill-down
- Dynamic date range selectors (MTD, QTD, Rolling 5 Weeks, etc.)
- KPIs: Spend, Impressions, Clicks, CTR, ROAS, CAC

### üß© Technical Highlights
- Custom dimensions to classify campaigns by funnel stage (based on naming conventions or fallback hardcoded rules)
- Scheduled dashboard delivery to stakeholders via email

### üí• Business Impact
- Eliminated manual weekly reporting for the paid media manager
- Delivered consistent, executive-ready performance summaries with no analyst intervention

### üß† Campaign Funnel Classification: `funnel_type` Dimension

To power funnel-stage analysis across paid media campaigns, I created a robust custom dimension in LookML that classifies campaigns as **Upper**, **Mid**, or **Lower Funnel**.

#### üîß How It Works:
- Hardcoded list of legacy campaigns for guaranteed accuracy
- Pattern-matching logic for newer campaigns with naming consistency
- Catch-all fallback using keywords (`Awareness`, `Conversion`, etc.)
- All unmatched campaigns are labeled as `Unidentified` to preserve completeness

### üìÑ Example LookML Snippet

```lookml
dimension: funnel_type {
  type: string
  label: "Funnel Type"
  description: "Categorizes campaigns into funnel stages based on the campaign name"
  sql:
    CASE
      WHEN ${campaign_name} IN (...) THEN 'Upper'
      WHEN ${campaign_name} IN (...) THEN 'Mid'
      WHEN ${campaign_name} IN (...) THEN 'Lower'
      WHEN ${campaign_name} LIKE 'TNT|Drip Drop|YouTube|Remarketing|%' THEN 'Mid'
      WHEN ${campaign_name} LIKE '%Awareness%' OR ${campaign_name} LIKE '%_UF_%' THEN 'Upper'
      ...
      ELSE 'Unidentified'
    END ;;
}
```


## üìà Project 2: Executive Pulse Dashboard

**Audience**: C-Level and Executive Leadership  
**Goal**: Provide an automated, high-level pulse on business health covering both short-term and long-term performance.

### üîç Features
- Two-part structure: **"Last 12 Months"** and **"Last 5 Weeks"**
- Unique line chart design overlaying:
  - üü¶ Current Year Actuals  
  - üü® Previous Year Actuals  
  - üü• YoY % Change  
- Metrics: Revenue, Orders, Sessions, CAC, LTV, Retention Rate
- Auto-scheduled delivery to executive inboxes

### üß© Technical Highlights
- **YoY calculation** using ISO week matching instead of simple calendar weeks for accuracy
- Custom time-window dimensions to dynamically control report breakdown:
  - `is_last_5_weeks`
  - `is_last_12_months`
  - `is_yoy_comparable`
- Dynamic flagging enabled intuitive dashboard filtering without needing manual parameter controls
- Created a custom LookML view to unify **historical and live spend data** across Amazon, Meta, and other platforms  
  Archived spend data was collected in **Google Sheets**, imported via **Daasity** into Snowflake, and merged with active platform data.  
  This enabled one **master spend dataset** to support full YoY analytics with no data gaps.

### üìÑ Master Spend View Snippet

To merge historical and current paid media data, I created a custom view that unified data from Amazon, Meta, and other platforms into a single spend dataset. This ensured executive dashboards could reflect accurate YoY performance, even when legacy data wasn't in our primary systems.

```lookml
view: vendor_performance_plus_historical {
  derived_table: {
    sql:
      SELECT * FROM DAASITY_DB.UMS.VENDOR_PERFORMANCE
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM DAASITY_DB.GSHEETS.DS_AMAZON_HISTORICAL_FINAL
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM DAASITY_DB.AMAZON_DSP_JAN01_2023_TO_DEC31_2024.GSHEETS
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM DAASITY_DB.AMAZON_DSP_JAN01_2025_TO_CURRENT.GSHEETS
      UNION ALL
      SELECT * FROM DAASITY_DB.GOOGLEADS_HISTORICALDATA_JAN01_2023_TO_AUG31_2024.GSHEETS
    ;;
  }

  # Dimension for period (current vs comp)
  dimension: period {
    type: string
    sql: ${calendar_v2.period} ;;
  }

  dimension: id {
    type: string
    sql: ${TABLE}.id ;;
  }

# other dimensions and measures
  END ;;
}
```
